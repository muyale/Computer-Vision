 The purpose of these projects is to enhance creating of data solutions through computer vision.
 Reproducability of the code is highly encouraged as so is the upvote. The projects vary from beginner to advance ,basically its a shot in the dark or some may call it  winging it .
As I advance ,let this be a reminder that all big things start small Hope I make you see this way 
Using Torchvision and Torch.nn I will create solutions for some of the unsolved problems .
